I know its hard to help me, I just feel better by talking to someone.\nHelper: I'm really sorry you weren't able to get relief with medication. I understand that having someone to talk to can be a relief when you feel so anxious. Do you have any close friends or family that you can talk to more often?\nSeeker: Yeah I actually have my best friends and every time i feel horrible I talked to them. But sometimes its just difficult cause bringing the same issue over and over can be exhausting for them.\nHelper: I'm sure your friend is glad to be able to lend a listening ear. Sometimes we need to hash out our problems more than once to resolve them. Do you like to exercise? It can be a great way to relieve anxiety and exhaust your body so you sleep better.\nSeeker: Actually, yes. I do a lot of exercise and that actually helps me sleep a little.\nHelper: I'm so glad to hear you have some outlet for your anxiety that helps with your sleep. Keeping your body healthy can be a great start to getting your mind in a more calm space. If you don't mind me asking, do you work a lot of hours outside your home?\nSeeker: No, I'm a student and with the pandemic and all that it's virtual but that keeps me busy.\nHelper: I see. Being at home alone most of the time, even when you have virtual meetings, may be contributing to your anxiety. Maybe you could meet up with friends in person at a park or other outdoor location. Is that possible?\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\"], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to help the seeker explore possible solutions.

He was only 26 years old\nHelper: There's nothing that can prepare you for unexpected tragedies like this.

I feel helpless because there is nothing I can do to make her feel better.\nHelper: It sounds like you're sticking close to your friend, although it doesn't feel like its helping. It's my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that, making someone feel better, at least right away, isn't always an option. The most important thing you can do for her is just to be there for her and allow her to feel however she needs to feel right now.\nSeeker: She is inconsolable..... and me also being upset is not helping matters either. You are exactly right...it's impossible to help. That is great advice...thank you. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen\nHelper: Of course. These things are tough to face on your own, so you did the right thing by reaching out. I know you want to be there for your friend as much as possible, and I think that will help you to move through grief at the same time, but just be mindful to not overextend yourself too much.

I am so broken up and also disgusted from my break-up with my only long-term partner. I was so surprised by the hurtful things he said when we broke up I just don't know how to even manage my feelings about all the time we spent together.\nHelper: I am so sorry to hear that. I know how that feels. That is horrible he said hurtful things, but perhaps he didn't know how to manage what he was feeling. Was it a mutual breakup or did something happen?\nSeeker: Well, I suppose for him it came out of nowhere. But for me I just had slowly come to the realization that he was not the person for me. I fell out of love with him slowly and grew more annoyed by a lot of his behaviors. To me we were fighting a lot, and about dumb stuff like whether or not a salad is a meal. And I realized that we were fighting so much because I wanted him to eat healthier and be healthier and he was not going to change and it wasn't even right for me to change him if he didn't want help. So, I am sure he felt attacked and unattractive and so he lashed out at me.\nHelper: Realizing someone isn't the same you fell in love with seems valid. Fighting over a salad is definately not something most couples argue over. He probably did feel attacked, but I am sure he noticed the continual fighting as well. It sounds like you did what was best for you. We all deserve to be happy, and it sounds like you really were not anymore. Are you having any regrets on the breakup?\nSeeker: I think I did the right thing, not just for me but for him. It isn't fair to keep dating someone just because being single is hard. I just still get weird lingering feelings wondering if he was right and maybe I am too much for a lot of people. I don't think he is right, and my friends disagree but it still hurts and I can still hear him tell me no one would ever love me. No, I don't think I have any regrets.\nHelper: I think I have said the same thing in a breakup so I wouldn't take that personal.\nSeeker: Yeah? I suppose people just say things when they are hurt.\nHelper: People say things they dont mean, or just say mean things to hurt because they are hurting. lol exactly. I bet there is someone out there for you, you jut need to find someone whos ideas of the future line up with yours\nSeeker: Thank you. Hopefully someone who doesn't fight over whether salad is valid dinner choice!\nHelper: Perhaps if you set up a dating profile have that be an intro question: is a salad a meal? you can weed people out that way!!!!\nSeeker: haha yeah!\nHelper: It sounds like you are going to be okay, and I am sure you will find someone when the time is right!\nSeeker: Yeah.

Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are.\nHelper: I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to provide empathy and validate the seeker's feelings, without making the focus about the helper's own experiences.

I'm getting too old for those games\nHelper: I understand where you are coming from. I've seen a lot of men in relationships not be so committed for real, but just like the physical part.\nSeeker: yep. like my aunt said why pay for the milk when you can get the cow for free. i've done that for years and im getting tired of it. not to mention my libido is slowing down so i see things clearer\nHelper: Just from chatting with you, I see that you feel like you want more from the relationship and would like commitment on more than one level.\nSeeker: yes when it comes down to it. and i don't know if i will ever find it- especially these days. and i don't want to settle\nHelper: I had to look for someone who was committed in all areas and only figured this out after making mistakes. I can see you have really shown maturity in learning from your experiences.\nSeeker: it's easy to settle when you're attracted to the guy. I have learned a lot from my past. I'm afraid the two might find out about each other. Not sure if it's a good thing or not\nHelper: From what I've seen having confidence in yourself and what you feel in your heart won't lie.\nSeeker: do you think it's good if they find out about each other? sometimes guys try harder when they know there is competition. sometimes it makes them run the other way\nHelper: Do you think one may have jealousy and get aggressive if he finds out?

Since that time, he denies everything.\nSeeker: I know. I'm a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It's superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas 'punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.\nHelper: Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER!. Curiously, why do you think she's cheating?\nSeeker: I'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two.\nHelper: Hmm... So have you two live together?

No, I do well, it just causes me a great amount of stress.\nHelper: I hear you, I have been in a similar situation.

She should be proud I am even going to college.\nHelper: Exactly! there is nothing at all wrong with not being a straight A student. Have you tried to tell her how you feel about her behaviour and attitude towards your studies?\nSeeker: Exactly. I feel like there is this society stereotype of needing straight A's otherwise you are a failure or something. A bit, but she uses the \"I pay for your education\" card.

And she has no right to emotionally manipulate you by mentioning money.\nSeeker: I agree, but she does have money over my head, which sucks.

That's something to build on. That desire to \"get even\" is definitely understandable.\nSeeker: I appreciate that and have been thinking about character a lot lately. I do believe he cheated on me first, if that even matters now.\nHelper: Do you feel like you got what you needed from the experience, as in, that you've \"gotten even\"?\nSeeker: Yes, I feel very even! I won't do it again. Can I ever give up the guilt that I feel and move on in our relationship or do I have to tell him what I did? I have known couples who don't tell each other and they are happy now.\nHelper: While it may be true in general that honesty is the best policy, in this case I wouldn't suggest telling him. It is just going to cause angry feelings. But, the fact you already believed he cheated on you and it motivated you to do the same shows a basic lack of trust in this relationship.

Would you like to tell me more details?\nSeeker: Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else's pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss (the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year.\nHelper: That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be!. Are there any official routes that you can use to complain?\nSeeker: I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses. I don't think so... He's the VP there isn't anyone I can go to above him\nHelper: That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint? It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this\nSeeker: I don't know if it is or not... I used my EAP benefit through work where you can talk to a councilor for free (5 visits) and they said that it's unfortunate but they didn't think it was illegal.\nHelper: I am very sorry to hear that, that sounds extremely unfair to me.

While I am lucky to not work in sales since I know those jobs are extremely tough but the lack of reward is all the same.\nHelper: Are there other jobs available in your area that you could apply for that are more up your alley?\nSeeker: I have not seen anything worth jumping ship for. I am afraid of the old adage of the grass always looks greener from the other side of the fence. Meaning I leave this job and only find a worse job.\nHelper: I see., yes that could be a risk for sure.have you spoken to your manager to see if there may be other opportunities in the manufacturing facility for you? I bet they would rather retrain you for a different position than lose you.\nSeeker: Unfortunately there are no other positions at the place I work. Yes my boss is very well aware of how unhappy I am. He is also unhappy and has been looking for jobs too. It isn't that great of a place to work at. I have had 3 different friends leave my place of employment, I've just been to lazy to leave too. It's a catch 22, too lazy to leave but due to feeling sad from being here I don't have the energy to try to leave.\nHelper: Yes I can understand that. Sadness and depresion can lead one to feel depleted and lacking motivation to make change. I have been depressed and lacking motivation in the past, I remember how it felt.\nSeeker: Yes, I see a psychologist and she does her best to help me but ultimately it is up to me to make the changes I need to in life.\nHelper: Is there anything about your position that you could suggest improving to your boss, to make your job more interesting? Maybe some ideas you may have for streamlining the work or somethings? I'm glad to hear you have someone to talk to about it. Over time as you keep working on it I hope things will improve for you.\nSeeker: I've spoke things over with my boss, he has tried a few things. Currently we are in a holding pattern due to some upper management changes and we are awaiting to see how the new manager would like to run things.\nHelper: oh I see. Do you have hobbies outside of work that you find fulfilling?\nSeeker: I have been slacking on that too. Just don't find pleasure in anything anymore. Now that it is spring time though hopefully that changes.\nHelper: Lets hope the new manager improves things for you, it sounds like there is a ray of hope there!. Yes it's hard to get started on anything when we are down. I remember writing lists with very small goals on them. Small goals feel like mountains when we are down! Then I would work my way through that very short list and check things off if I could do them, which gave me a small lift of accomplishment.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to encourage the seeker to find small, manageable ways to get started with things they enjoy.

My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He's also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask...but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6-foot boundary. A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2.\nHelper: I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask?\nSeeker: I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. In my shoes, what would you do? Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol\nHelper: I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don't honor your requests?\nSeeker: It makes me feel trapped. Frustrated. I would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and I feel like I don t. *don't get the same courtesy. I feel frustrated because I'm REQUIRED to deal with people. I work in construction. I feel trapped because, what are my options? Continue to work.....my son gets sick and dies. His pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me. And if I quit? No money? I have a 5 year old I have to take care of too.\nHelper: I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue?\nSeeker: I've spoken to my boss. He was sympathetic about it all....At this point I'm not sure what to do.\nHelper: Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less?

I still keep on thinking about her.\nHelper: I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby.

So when do you find out whether or not you are on probation?\nSeeker: Likely in the next week. I registered for my classes for next semester but I think I should drop my minor. \\\nHelper: Okay gotcha. Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health. I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation\nSeeker: That's great advice and likely would be my best option. I will definitely do that. I feel better hearing that it's okay to drop my minor. I felt like a failure when I considered it.\nHelper: From talking with you so far, I can tell that you are stressed about this.

I typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. So I am trying to cut out drinking.\nHelper: So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety?

Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep...the amount you drink. Do your friends encourage you to drink more?\nSeeker: They don't necessarily attempt to get me to drink more in volume, but I do have to tell them I'm not gonna go out for the night.\nHelper: Are they okay with it when you decline?\nSeeker: Yes after one or two statements they give up.\nHelper: Okay so they ask you a couple of times and then they move on.

I'm sure you have other interests in life that maybe you could drag your friends out to enjoy so that might help...sober fun!

I keep thinking about all the times I disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and I never got to tell him how much I loved him.\nHelper: Your dad wouldn't want to see you grieving everyday either. You should live the way you know he'd love to see. I believe he knew you loved him regardless how much you two argued\nSeeker: I know that he did :).

I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together.\nHelper: you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that's something he would do?\nSeeker: I can try that, I think he might be responsive at first if I dont set him off. All of his friends hate me so I have nobody on my side right now. Should I try to get his friends to like me again? Is that an way I could use to get him to want me again?\nHelper: nobody likes to see that one's friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back\nSeeker: I can understand what you mean. I need to think this through.\nHelper: what made you like someone else in the first place?\nSeeker: Well, we are in a small town and he was popular and the cutest guy in our town. I liked being with someone so popular. He wasn't always nice to me and is why I wanted to be with someone else for a short time. He used to leave me at parties and go off with his friends sometimes.\nHelper: was it a common thing that he didn't give you the attention you wanted?\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to understand the seeker's feelings and situation better.

I know right now... its a hard time for so many people. I have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks.\nSeeker: Sorry about that. This is about my relationship.\nHelper: Ah....relationship worries can be so draining and emotionally exhausting. I can understand that.
